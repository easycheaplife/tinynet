3 when reading from buffer,wpos_ changed at another thread,but is as a factor for read,that will cause a overflow. 
4 data coverage for write quick fast than read and more than a cycle when using select model.
5 memory overflow when read data from system cache, but the ring buffer is not enough.
6 if client request very fast, it will occupy all of resource, other thread will get no resource when using select model.
7 implement server_imple::read_completely again, improve the stability of server,and fix the problem of data coverage. 
8 add a sub class srv_test/cli_test from server_impl/client_impl for test,more convenient for using you game server.
