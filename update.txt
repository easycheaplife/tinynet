V 1.1.0
1 add vs2012 win32 solution tinynet client code 

2014/8/22
V 1.1.1
1 add MIT License

V 2.0.0
1 redefine base data type
2 use cmake generate win32 solution replace use existing.
3 when reading from buffer,wpos_ changed at another thread,but is as a factor for read,that will cause a overflow. 
4 data coverage for write quick fast than read and more than a cycle when using select model.
5 memory overflow when read data from system cache, but the ring buffer is not enough.
6 if client request very fast, it will occupy all of resource, other thread will get no resource when using select model.
7 implement server_imple::read_completely again, improve the stability of server,and fix the problem of data coverage. 
8 add a sub class srv_test/cli_test from server_impl/client_impl for test,more convenient for using you game server.
9 adaptive the iocp model at windows,unification api for all model,you do not care about how to implement the model,just use it for everyone.

V 2.1.0
1 add mac plantform support for using select model.
2 optimize code, remove repeat code.
3 fix bug #20005 data lose at write thread.
4 change the packet head from 16 bits to 32 bits for testing protobuf way.
5 providing a way to read data from system cache directly replace for using a buffer to cache at application layer.
6 add a lock for select event_, to avoid event_ accessed by multi thread.
